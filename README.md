# Tic-Tac-Toe

A very primitive Tic-Tac-Toe game I've made after learning more about objects and objects constructors. But it was quite a challenge implementing objects, so the game uses one huge factory function for the whole gameboard.

1. Player X and Player O make moves in turn starting with Player X
2. If someone won, the game displays the winning player under the game field
3. If game continues, the same line displays which player is to make a move next

Player 1 is X and Player 2 is O

After the game ends players can still place their marks on the field, but the game result stays the same even if a non-winner player manages to create a winning combination
